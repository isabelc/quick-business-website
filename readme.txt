Business website to showcase your services, staff, announcements, a working contact form, and reviews.

== Description ==

Get a complete business website up with a few clicks. When you activate this plugin, your website will immediately have: 

- a Reviews page for visitors to review your business
- a Contact page with a working contact form
- a section to showcase your Staff, with links to their social profiles
- a section to showcase your Services
- an Announcements section to post sales, events, news, or anything
- 6 Quick Business Website widgets
- Table buttons in your post editor to easily create tables (makes it easy to create a pricelist)
- the wp-login.php page will show your blogname with a link to your home page, instead of "WordPress" linking to WordPress.
- Backend branding tweaks: You can change or remove the footer text in the WP Admin area. You can remove the WordPress links from Admin/tool bar.
- You can add your Google Analytics or other scripts via the options panel, without touching your code.

After you enter your business information, your site will then automatically have:

- Schema.org `LocalBusiness` microdata on the Contact page, as [recommended by Google](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=99170&topic=1088472&ctx=topic), to help generate rich snippets for your business in Google search.
- an 'About' page
- the Contact page will display, in addition to the contact form, links to your business's social profiles (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Youtube, etc.), business hours, address, phone, fax number, and email address (all optional). 

When you get your first review, your site will then automatically have:

- `aggregateRating` Schema.org microdata which will add stars to your website in Google search results, making your site stand out.
